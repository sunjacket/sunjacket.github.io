# Sunjacket

## About

Sunjacket is a three-piece indie rock band from Chicago. In the fall of 2014, Bryan Kveton (vocals, guitar, synth), Carl Hauck (vocals, guitar, synth), and Garret Bodette (drums, percussion) took a year off from playing shows to finish writing and recording songs for their debut LP.

The result is *Mantra*, a 10-track album whose songs range from dark, synth-driven pop to layered, syncopated rock, with moments of ambient sparseness in between.

The album, due out September 16, 2016, was produced in collaboration with Fraser McCulloch (of Brooklyn band Milagres) and mastered by Joe Lambert (Animal Collective, Deerhunter, Dirty Projectors, Local Natives).
